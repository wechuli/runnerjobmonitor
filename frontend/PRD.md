# GitHub Actions Runner Observability Tool - Product Requirements Document

A comprehensive web application for visualizing observability data from self-hosted GitHub Actions runners, enabling users to navigate through organizations, repositories, workflow runs, and jobs to view detailed metrics and performance analysis.

**Experience Qualities**:
1. **Professional** - Clean, technical interface that inspires confidence in enterprise development teams
2. **Analytical** - Data-driven visualization with clear insights and actionable recommendations
3. **Efficient** - Fast navigation and minimal friction between data hierarchy levels

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
  - Multi-level navigation hierarchy with simulated backend integration
  - Time-series data visualization with interactive charts
  - Simulated authentication flow prepared for real OAuth integration

## Essential Features

### Authentication Flow
- **Functionality**: GitHub OAuth simulation with persistent session state
- **Purpose**: Gate application access while maintaining pluggable architecture for real OAuth
- **Trigger**: User lands on application without authentication
- **Progression**: Landing page → Click "Sign in with GitHub" → Auth context updates → Main dashboard
- **Success criteria**: User gains access to main application, can logout and return to login screen

### Organization Hierarchy Navigation
- **Functionality**: Progressive drill-down through Orgs → Repos → Runs → Jobs
- **Purpose**: Allow users to navigate their GitHub infrastructure to find specific job executions
- **Trigger**: User authenticates and lands on organizations list
- **Progression**: Orgs list → Select org → Repos list → Select repo → Runs list → Select run → Jobs list → Select job → Detailed analysis
- **Success criteria**: Each level loads appropriate mock data, breadcrumb navigation works, back navigation maintains context

### Time-Series Metrics Visualization
- **Functionality**: Individual Recharts graphs for CPU, Memory, Disk, and Process metrics
- **Purpose**: Visualize runner performance over job execution timeline
- **Trigger**: User selects a specific job from jobs list
- **Progression**: Job selection → Load metrics data → Render separate charts → Interactive hover states
- **Success criteria**: Each metric displays in its own chart, data points are accurate, tooltips show precise values

### Job Log Viewer
- **Functionality**: Simulated console log output with timestamps and step information
- **Purpose**: Provide execution context alongside metrics for debugging
- **Trigger**: Job detail page loads
- **Progression**: Fetch job details → Display logs in scrollable container → Syntax highlighting
- **Success criteria**: Logs display with proper formatting, scrollable, readable timestamps

### AI-Powered Analysis
- **Functionality**: Simulated LLM analysis of job performance with recommendations
- **Purpose**: Provide actionable insights without manual metric interpretation
- **Trigger**: User clicks "Analyze Job" button on job detail page
- **Progression**: Click analyze → Show loading state (2-3s) → Display simulated analysis → Show recommendations
- **Success criteria**: Loading state appears, analysis text displays with proper formatting, recommendations are clear

## Edge Case Handling

- **Empty States** - Display helpful messages when no data exists at any hierarchy level
- **Loading States** - Show skeleton loaders during all async operations to prevent layout shift
- **Network Simulation** - Mock API includes realistic latency (100-500ms) to test loading states
- **Invalid Navigation** - Redirect to appropriate level if user manually enters invalid URL
- **Long Job Logs** - Implement virtualized scrolling for logs exceeding 1000 lines

## Design Direction

The design should feel professional and technical, optimized for software engineers and DevOps teams. The interface prioritizes data density and quick scanning over decorative elements, with a clean, modern aesthetic similar to GitHub's own interface. Visualization takes center stage with ample negative space around charts.

## Color Selection

**Triadic** color scheme with technical, enterprise-focused palette balanced by accent colors for data visualization.

- **Primary Color**: Deep slate blue `oklch(0.35 0.05 250)` - Conveys technical professionalism and stability
- **Secondary Colors**: 
  - Muted gray `oklch(0.6 0.01 250)` for secondary actions and borders
  - Soft background `oklch(0.98 0.005 250)` for cards and sections
- **Accent Color**: Vibrant blue `oklch(0.55 0.18 250)` - Highlights interactive elements and primary CTAs
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (Light Gray #FAFBFC): Dark text `oklch(0.2 0.01 250)` - Ratio 12.5:1 ✓
  - Card (White #FFFFFF): Dark text `oklch(0.2 0.01 250)` - Ratio 16:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Slate #3D4F66): White text `oklch(0.98 0 0)` - Ratio 7.2:1 ✓
  - Accent (Vibrant Blue #2D7FF9): White text `oklch(0.98 0 0)` - Ratio 4.8:1 ✓
  - Destructive (Red #DC2626): White text `oklch(0.98 0 0)` - Ratio 5.9:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Use **Inter** for its excellent readability at small sizes and professional technical aesthetic, combined with **JetBrains Mono** for code/log display to maintain authenticity.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Page Titles): Inter SemiBold/32px/tight tracking (-0.02em)
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter Medium/24px/tight tracking (-0.01em)
  - H3 (Card Headers): Inter Medium/18px/normal tracking
  - Body (Content): Inter Regular/14px/relaxed line-height (1.6)
  - Small (Metadata): Inter Regular/12px/normal tracking
  - Code (Logs): JetBrains Mono Regular/13px/normal line-height (1.5)

## Animations

Animations should be minimal and purposeful, primarily serving to guide attention during navigation transitions and reinforce interactive feedback. Avoid gratuitous motion that could distract from data analysis.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Page transitions use subtle slides to convey hierarchy direction (forward = slide left, back = slide right)
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: 
  - Critical: Loading states and data updates (fade in with slight scale)
  - Important: Chart interactions and hover states (immediate color transitions)
  - Subtle: Navigation transitions (200ms ease-out slide)

## Component Selection

- **Components**:
  - **Card** - Primary container for all list items (orgs, repos, runs, jobs) with hover elevation
  - **Button** - Primary/secondary variants for actions, ghost variant for navigation
  - **Breadcrumb** - Navigation context at top of hierarchy views
  - **Separator** - Divide sections on job detail page
  - **ScrollArea** - Log viewer with custom scrollbar styling
  - **Skeleton** - Loading placeholders matching content layout
  - **Badge** - Status indicators (success, failure, in_progress) with color coding
  - **Tabs** - Switch between different metric views or chart configurations
- **Customizations**:
  - **MetricCard** - Custom component combining Card with stat display
  - **ChartContainer** - Wrapper for Recharts with consistent sizing and responsive behavior
  - **LogLine** - Custom component for syntax-highlighted log entries
- **States**:
  - Buttons: Default, Hover (subtle scale 1.02), Active (pressed shadow), Disabled (opacity 0.5)
  - Cards: Default, Hover (border accent + shadow), Selected (accent border)
  - Inputs: Default, Focus (accent ring), Error (destructive border)
- **Icon Selection**:
  - Organization: Buildings (building-office)
  - Repository: Folder or code (folder-open)
  - Workflow Run: Play circle (play-circle)
  - Job: Cog or server (server)
  - Analytics: Chart line (chart-line)
  - GitHub: Brand icon (github-logo)
- **Spacing**: Consistent 4px base unit - cards use padding of 20px (5 units), gaps between items are 12px (3 units)
- **Mobile**: 
  - Hierarchy navigation stacks vertically
  - Charts reduce height and simplify tooltips
  - Job detail page shows single column layout
  - Sidebar (if implemented) collapses to hamburger menu
