## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Patterns

- **Component Pattern:** Functional components with hooks
- **State Management:** Local state with useState, global auth with Context
- **Data Fetching:** Async/await with useEffect
- **Error Handling:** Try-catch with error boundaries
- **Routing:** React Router with nested routes
- **Styling:** Utility-first with Tailwind CSS
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript with strict mode

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Mock API as Swappable Module**
   - Same function signatures as real API
   - Easy to replace without UI changes
   - Realistic latency simulation

2. **Separate Chart Components**
   - Reusable and maintainable
   - Each chart focuses on one metric
   - Consistent styling through props

3. **Breadcrumb Navigation**
   - Always shows current path
   - Allows navigation to any level
   - Better UX than just back button

4. **Loading Skeletons**
   - Prevents layout shift
   - Shows expected content structure
   - Better perceived performance

5. **Color-Coded Status**
   - Green for success
   - Red for failure
   - Blue for in-progress
   - Intuitive visual feedback
